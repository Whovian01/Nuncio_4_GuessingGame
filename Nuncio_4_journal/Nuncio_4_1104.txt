A method is referred to by name and often has a return value
It can be called at any time in the program.

One method that i used in my game checks if the number that the player typed is even or odd.

A while loop is used to add something to happen while the boolean expression is true. 
It gets terminated when the expression returns as false.

We used a while loop do add a function to happen while the statement is true,
a boolean to detect whether something is true or false,and a counter to count 
how many guesses are left.
