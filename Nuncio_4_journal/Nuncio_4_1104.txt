A method is a set of code which is referred to by name and can be called at
any time in the program simply by using the method's name. Each method has its
own name and returns a value. 

One method that i used was one that sees if the number that the player 
typed in was even or not even.

A while loop does what it is told to do when the boolean expression returns
as true. It gets terminated when the expression returns as false.
