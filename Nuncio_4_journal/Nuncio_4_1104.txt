A method is a set of code that acts on data and often has a return value
and is referred to by name and can be called at
any time in the program.

A while loop is ued to add something to happen while another thing is taking 
place or when it is true.

We used a while loop do add a function to happen while the statement is true,
a boolean to detect whether something is true or false,and a counter to count 
how many guesses are left.
